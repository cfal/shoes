# Reality + Vision server
# Combines censorship resistance with TLS-in-TLS optimization
#
# Reality provides censorship resistance through TLS 1.3 mimicry
# Vision provides zero-copy performance when TLS-in-TLS is detected
# Together they offer both benefits

        # When enabled, Vision detects TLS-in-TLS scenarios and switches

# Benefits of Reality + Vision:
# - Reality: Censorship resistance, looks like real TLS traffic
# - Vision: Zero-copy performance, better anti-detection
# - Combined: Maximum security and performance
