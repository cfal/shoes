# Reality + Vision client configuration
# Maximum performance and censorship resistance
#
# Reality provides censorship resistance through TLS 1.3 mimicry
# Vision provides zero-copy performance for TLS-in-TLS scenarios
# Together they offer both benefits with VLESS as the inner protocol

# Benefits of Reality + Vision client:
# - Censorship resistance: Looks like normal TLS traffic to censors
# - Performance: Vision provides zero-copy for TLS-in-TLS
# - Anti-detection: Vision adds padding to mimic real TLS patterns
# - Compatibility: Works with CDNs and middleboxes
