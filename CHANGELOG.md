# Changelog - v0.2.1

## New Features

### Client Chaining (`client_chains`)
Multi-hop proxy chains with load balancing support. Traffic can now be routed through multiple proxies in sequence.

- **Multi-hop chains**: Route traffic through multiple proxies sequentially (e.g., `proxy1 -> proxy2 -> target`)
- **Round-robin chains**: Specify multiple chains and rotate between them for load distribution
- **Pool-based load balancing**: At each hop, use a pool of proxies for load balancing
- New config fields: `client_chain` (singular) and `client_chains` (multiple)
- See `examples/multi_hop_chain.yaml` for usage examples

### TUIC v5 Zero-RTT Handshake
New `zero_rtt_handshake` option for TUIC v5 servers enables 0-RTT (0.5-RTT for server) handshakes for faster connection establishment.

```yaml
protocol:
  type: tuic
  uuid: "..."
  password: "..."
  zero_rtt_handshake: true  # Default: false
```

Note: 0-RTT is vulnerable to replay attacks. Only enable if the latency benefit outweighs security concerns.

### Reality Cipher Suites
Both Reality server and client now support specifying TLS 1.3 cipher suites.

```yaml
# Server
reality_targets:
  "example.com":
    cipher_suites: ["TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384", "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"]
    ...

# Client
protocol:
  type: reality
  cipher_suites: ["TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"]
  ...
```

Valid values: `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`

### Reality Client Version Control
Server-side Reality configuration can now restrict client versions:

```yaml
reality_targets:
  "example.com":
    min_client_version: [1, 8, 0]  # [major, minor, patch]
    max_client_version: [2, 0, 0]
    ...
```

## Deprecations

### `client_proxy` / `client_proxies` in Rules
The `client_proxy` and `client_proxies` fields in rule configurations are deprecated in favor of `client_chain` and `client_chains`.

**Migration**: Replace `client_proxy:` with `client_chain:` in your configuration files. The old fields still work but will emit a warning and may be removed in a future version.

Before:
```yaml
rules:
  - masks: "0.0.0.0/0"
    action: allow
    client_proxy: my-proxy-group
```

After:
```yaml
rules:
  - masks: "0.0.0.0/0"
    action: allow
    client_chain: my-proxy-group
```

### VMess `force_aead` / `aead` Fields
The `force_aead` and `aead` fields in VMess configuration are deprecated. AEAD mode is now always enabled, and non-AEAD (legacy) mode is no longer supported.

**Migration**: Remove `force_aead` and `aead` fields from your VMess configurations. They have no effect and will be ignored.

## Removed / Breaking Changes

### VMess Non-AEAD Mode Removed
VMess non-AEAD (legacy) mode is no longer supported. All VMess connections now use AEAD encryption exclusively. This improves security but breaks compatibility with very old VMess clients that don't support AEAD.

## Other Changes

- Hysteria2 and TUIC servers now have authentication timeouts (3 seconds by default) to prevent connection hogging
- Improved fragment packet handling with LRU cache eviction
- TUIC server now sends heartbeat packets to maintain connection liveness
